Lenns info
The Nodal Point of the lens (or more correctly, the entrance pupil) can be considered as the point at which the rays entering the lens converge. It can also be considered as the centre of perspective of the lens or the apparent pupil. 
 
 
  
HDR: (if not PBR will be affected)    
AEB examples:  
13EV's of scene light for interiors (7 shots with 2EV)  
26EVs for Outdoors - Sun visible sometimes even on -20EV  

#### Shoot
Shoot RAW - 14 bit compression, (16 bit if possible)  
Orient set to recognize front direction  

Shoot in central point of scene: Cannot change EV during shot.    
`Color checker` - white ballans. from differences between shoot and CG create transform matrix to neutralize colour cast (shoot fulll exposure)   
`Gray card` - to set base EV (correctly expoing for 18% grey calibration card (fill frame) which is oriented twoward main light (without shadow))  
`Gray ball` -  lighting intensity and direction 18% grey (like lambert shading)   
`Chroma ball` -  help to correct Lightprobe rotation and light locations- shoot front and side   
`Lightprobe` shot for HDRI shoot with 8mm lens 3 shoots 0 120 240
