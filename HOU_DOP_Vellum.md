# Vellum Solver 


i@layer = layer shock on solver 

# Vellum Solver drape  
`planar patch from curve` - from curves  
`planar patch` - only simple shapes  
`planar pleat` - make patterns  
welding frame - where it start to fuse  (maby work on frame 1 ?)  


# VELLUM CONSTRAINTS

# Vellum Cloth setup
disiatance & bend constran  
thicknsee on drape see resoult in postprocess spheres could by to big  depend on `scale`  

# Workflows  
### mirroring cloth:

`Name_RB` -   Right Back  
`Name_RF` -   Right Front  
`Name_LB` -   Left Back  
`Name_LF` -   Left Front
