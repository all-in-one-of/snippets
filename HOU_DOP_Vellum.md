# VELLUM
Vellum XPBD is expansion of grain PBD - pos base dynamic. Ppoints + constraints

# [Vellum Solver] 
Constraint iteration + substeps   
Colision iterations are lower cause are cost expensive   
Smoothing error iters   

#### Forces 
Drag - if stuff in simulation have to much energy you can increse drag !!!!   
#### Advancde
Second order is more precisem, but canhav issues on colllsion, (bounce) if that turn on max accel

To break hard constraint:  
i@stoped = 0;   
i@pintoanimation = 0;
