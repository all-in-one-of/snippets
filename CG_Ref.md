#### 3dScan   
- Massive source make unable to move/scale geo.    
- Reduce from mid res with reduced details, get rid of bridges, valleys, noise, unfolds, duplinverted faces, Dynamesh.   
- AutoReduce is not shape aware and less efficient(30%),   
- hard to uv (fliped edges connections) and hard to select edge loop select edges.     
- light removing is huge problem  
- Bake into mid res >> transfer geo    

#### Procedural   
- Imported blueprints have different formats.
- Build geo from curves and points.  
- Make Mid -  using crease! 
- Conform with ray to match Hi.  

#### Sculpt  
- Quick mid with creases to subd with smooth    
- Use Dynamesh on already smooth geo    (scale!)  
- Retopo by hand

   - Dont make excuses.   
   - Dont save on hardware  
   - Pipelines: to make data and information flow throu easy   
   
#### References   
   - Refer to human scale and relations  
   - Dna: `Culture`, `Time`, `Period`, `Function`    
   - Material: `Substance`, `Stiffness`  
   - Age: `Wear`, `Tear`, `Erosion`, `Dirt`

#### Design 
   - `Line` `Shape` `Form` `Color` `Value` `Space (+negative)` `Text`   
   
#### Sketch > Draw    
   - (proportion, shape recog)  
   - (bigest to smallest details)   
   - Flip  for perspective correction     
   - Thumbnails for detail correction    
   - B&W for valor correction    
   
#### Shading
   - Work in `HSV` to manage `Chroma` and `Valor`.    
   
#### Paint    
   - high key painting has a `high-value` scale (light) whilst a low key painting uses a `low-value` scale (dark).  
   - Color `Monochrom`, `Analogous`, `Complimentary`, `Split-Complementary`, `Triad(3)`, `Tetradic(4)`   
   - Color temperature  vs  neutral colors (W&B and gray)  
   - Edges change in `Object`, `Plane` or `Color`. Can be  hard, soft or lost.  
   - Edge Avoid: `Hidden`, `Skimed fused`, `Stolen` egde of objects  
 
#### Sculpt  
   - `Siluette` > `Midium Freqences` > `Detail`      
   - Varie details placement.     
   - Sculpt across the form (not with the flow).    
   - Don't use smooth.       

#### Scene Setup   
   - keep texel density  
   - `Sky box` > `Exp fog` > `Sky Light` > `Directional Light` > `Secondary lights` > `Cam Post` > `Color Grading`    
   
#### Simulation & procedural   
   - fit parameters to 0-1  

#### Composition
   - rule of 3rd  
   - sectio aurea a+b/a = 1.618 φ  - golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is φ  
   - `Balance`, `Proportion`, `Movement`, `Rhythm`, `Harmony`, `Unity`, `Emphasis`, `Variety`   

#### Story
   - Heroes Journey: `You`, `Need`, `Go`, `Search`, `Find`, `Take`, `Return`, `Change`  
   - Cannot say a story without `place`, `time` and `character`. Or you can :> ?  
   - Character reveale when human characters make choices under pressuere    
       
#### Camera  
   - Depth Frameing Croping 
   - Avoid unnecesery moves, unwanted obj cutouts.   
   - `Depth of Field` `Grain` `Bloom` 
   
#### Light 
   - Unmotivated Light - Support light that doesn't have a physical representation.  
   - `Key light`, `Fill light`, `Rim light`,  `Direct`, `Indirect`, `Ambient`, `Difuse light ` 
   
#### Cut
   - J cut - sound precedes the cut  - smoooth scene introduction
