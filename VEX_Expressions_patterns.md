### HScript

`$OS` - Operator String. Contains the current OPâ€™s name.  
`$CH` - Current channel name.  
 
`$F` - The current frame, (as set with the Playbar controls). This is a very useful variable, especially for rendered picture filename numbering.  
`$HFS` - The directory where Houdini is installed.  
`$HH` - $HFS/houdini. 
`$HIP` - The directory containing the current scene file.  
`$HIPFILE` - The full path of the current scene file, including the file extension.  
`$HIPNAME` - The name of the current scene file without the extension. You can use this to build filenames with different extensions based on the scene name.  
`$PDG_DIR`   
`$PDG_SHARED_ROOT`  
`$HOME` - Your home directory.  
`$JOB` - The project directory.  
`$NFRAMES` (the number of frames in the animation) = $FEND - $FSTART + 1.  
`$ACTIVETAKE` - Contains the name of the current take.   


### Arithmetic 
```cpp
=, == (same as), !=, >, <, >=,  <=
+=  
++ - add one
% - modulus
```
### Conditionals:
``` coffeescript
! - Logic negation
== - equal
!= - is not equal
|| - Logic OR
&& - Logic AND
```
### Patterns:
```cpp

//Pattern may be a numeric pattern, attribute pattern, or group name pattern.

? // Match any character
* // Match any substring
^ // Exclude from match
[list] // Match any of the characters specified in the list.
!*  // ????????????
a*,^aardvark //- Match any string beginning with a except for aardvark.
[abc]*z  //- Match any string beginning with a, b or c and ending with z.
g*,^geo* //- Match any string beginning with g, but not any string beginning with geo.
^pattern    //Remove points/primitives matching  
//For example, 0-100:2 ^10-20 every other number 1 to 100 except the 10 to 20.
!pattern  //Every point/primitive except the ones matching the pattern. 
//For example, !1-10 means every point/prim except the numbers 1 to 10. 
```
### Points/primitives numbered:
```cpp
n  // number n.
n-m  //  from n to m (inclusive).
n-m:step // from n to m (inclusive) skipping every step. 
//For example, 1-100:2 means every other number from 1 to 100.
n-m:keep,step // from n to m (inclusive). 
//Use the first keep numbers and then skip every step after that.
```
