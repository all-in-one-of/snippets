### 3dScan   
- Massive source make unable to move/scale geo.    
- Reduce from mid res with reduced details, get rid of bridges, valleys, noise, unfolds, duplinverted faces, Dynamesh.   
- AutoReduce is not shape aware and less efficient(30%),   
- hard to uv (fliped edges connections) and hard to select edge loop select edges.     
- light removing is huge problem  
- Bake into mid res >> transfer geo    

### Procedural   
- Imported blueprints have different formats.
- Build geo from curves and points.  
- Make Mid -  using crease! 
- Conform with ray to match Hi.  

### Sculpt  
- Quick mid with creases to subd with smooth    
- Use Dynamesh on already smooth geo    (scale!)  
- Retopo by hand

   - Dont save on hardware

Sculpt  
   - Siluette  
   - Dont forget aboud mid freq.    
   - Varie details placement.     
   - Sculpt across the form (not with the flow).    
   - Don't use smooth.       

Scene Setup   
   - keep texel density  
   - Sky box > Exp fog > Sky Light > Directional Light > Secondary lights > Post (dof/grain/bloom) > Color Grading    

Shading
   - Work in HSV to manage chroma and valor.      
   
Simulation & procedural   
   - fit parameters to 0-1  

Composition
   - rule of 3rd  
   - sectio aurea a+b/a = 1.618 φ  - golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is φ  
   - Balance / Proportion / Movement / Rhythm / Harmony / Unity / Emphasis / Variety  
   
Design 
   - line / shape / form / color / value / space (+negative) / text
