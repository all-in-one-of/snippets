# NOISE TYPES:
```cpp
perlin // perlin moze miec artefakty 
simplex  // faster

spare convolution // chyba do chmur ???
sinus //

worley //  Computes 1D, 3D, and 4D Worley noise, which is synonymous with "cell noise".
voronoi //  Voronoi noise, which is similar to Worley noise but has additional control over jittering.
cell // Computes 2D, anti-aliased cellular noise suitable for shading.
alligator //

hebyshev  // kwadratowy H16.5z
manhattan // kwadratowy H16.5
```
### Anti Alias noise  - [0.5 - .5]  
// (szybszy niz unified) compute band-limited noise.
compute band-limited noise. This type of noise is ideal for shading

### Unified noise [0-1]  
// normal > normalize > N  // wiecej opcji niz AA   (Presents a unified interface and uniform output range for all the noise types available in VEX.)
```

### Turbulence noise compute turbulence with roughness and attenuation

**Original Perlin** // similar to Perlin noise, but marginally less efficient in computation and with different characteristics. The bounds on the noise are roughly (-1, 1) when turbulence is 0.
**Perlin** // sums octaves of a noise with range about (0, 1), resulting in a non-zero centered result. Thus the zero centered perlin better matches the ranges of the other noise fields.
**Simplex** // close to Perlin noise, except with the samples on a simplex mesh rather than a grid. This results in less grid artifacts. It also uses a higher order bspline to provide better derivatives
**Alligator** // similar to Worley It is currently not possible to simulate Alligator noise using the Worley functions, but it is possible to get a very similar 'look'. The bounds on the noise are roughly (0, 0.5) when turbulence is 0.
**Sparse Convolution** // similar to Worley The noise returned is based on the weights of all of the closest points, with each pointâ€™s contribution based on a meta-ball like rolloff curve. That is, if the sample point is close to the sphere, its contribution will be greater. The bounds on the noise are roughly (-1.7, 1.7) when turbulence is 0

**Curl noise** // VECTOR NOISE!!!  function for perlin or simplex This operator generates divergence-free 3D noise

SET RANDOM COLOR: 
```cpp


float pscale = rand(@ptnum);
vector direction = rand(@ptnum); //will create rand float for x, y and z direction


float r = random(@ptnum+1);
float g = random(@ptnum+2);
float b = random(@ptnum+3);
@Cd = set(r,g,b);
```
Computes divergence free noise
```cpp
vector frequency = chv("Frequency");
vector offset = chv("Offset");

vector dir = curlnoise((@P * frequency) + offset);  //  perlin
vector dir = curlxnoise((@P * frequency) + offset);  //  simplex Computes a divergence free vector field based on the cross product of the derivatives of two simplex noise functions.
```
Simplex: noise is very close to Perlin noise, except with the samples on a simplex mesh rather than a grid. This results in less grid artifacts. It also uses a higher order bspline to provide better derivatives.
```
int ps[] = pointprims(0,@ptnum);
int p = ps[0];
vector offset =  xnoise(v@P + set(p,p,p)) - {.5,.5,.5};
v@P += offset;
```
