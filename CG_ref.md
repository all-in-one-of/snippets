### 3dScan   
- Massive source make unable to move/scale geo.    
- Reduce from mid res with reduced details, get rid of bridges, valleys, noise, unfolds, duplinverted faces, Dynamesh.   
- AutoReduce is not shape aware and less efficient(30%),   
- hard to uv (fliped edges connections) and hard to select edge loop select edges.     
- light removing is huge problem  
- Bake into mid res >> transfer geo    

### Procedural   
- Imported blueprints have different formats.
- Build geo from curves and points.  
- Make Mid -  using crease! 
- Conform with ray to match Hi.  

### Sculpt  
- Quick mid with creases to subd with smooth    
- Use Dynamesh on already smooth geo    (scale!)  
- Retopo by hand
