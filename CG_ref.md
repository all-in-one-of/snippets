### 3dScan   
- Massive source make unable to move/scale geo.    
- Reduce from mid res with reduced details, get rid of bridges, unfolds, duplicate/inverted faces, Dynamesh it.   
- AutoReduce is not shape aware and less efficient(30%), hard to uv (fliped edges connections) and select edges.        
- Bake into mid res >> transfer geo    

### Procedural   
- Imported blueprints have different formats.
- Build geo from curves and points.  
- Make Mid -  using crease! 
- Conform with ray to match Hi.  

### Sculpt  
- Quick mid with creases to subd with smooth    
- Use Dynamesh on already smooth geo    (scale!)  
- Retopo by hand
