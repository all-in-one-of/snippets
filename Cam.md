#### Camera 
- `Shutter Speed` = (1 / Time) = Fraction of a Second EV100 = ( log2(ApertureÂ² / (Shutter Speed) * 100 / ISO) )
- `f-number` = Aperture. Focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil. f/4 big hole - f/16 small 
- `ISO` - 

- `EV` Exposition Values - Eye 20 f-stops / best cams 16 / dlsr - up to 13  

The `Nodal Point` of the lens (or more correctly, the entrance pupil) can be considered as the point at which the rays entering the lens converge. It can also be considered as the centre of perspective of the lens or the apparent pupil.
