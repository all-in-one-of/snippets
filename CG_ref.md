### 3dScan   
- Massive source make unable to move/scale geo.    
- Reduce from mid res with reduced details, get rid of bridges, unfolds, duplicate/inverted faces, Dynamesh it.   
- AutoReduce is not shape aware and less efficient(30%), hard to uv (fliped edges connections) and select edges.        
- Bake into mid res >> transfer geo    

### Procedural   
- Imported blueprints have different formats.
- Build geo from curves and points.  
- Make Mid -  using crease! 
- Conform with ray to match Hi.  

### Sculpt  
- Quick mid with creases to subd with smooth    
- Use Dynamesh on already smooth geo    (scale!)  
- Retopo by hand

   - Read it with human scale and relations (bigest to smallest details), read paterns.     
   - Dna (culture, time period, function)   
   - Age (wear, tear, erosion, dirt)  

Draw 
   - Flip  for perspective correction   
   - Thumbs for detail correction   
   - B&W for valor correction   

Sculpt  
   - Siluette  
   - Dont forget aboud mid freq.    
   - Make contrast comp with details placement.     
   - Sculpt across the form (not with the flow).    
   - Don't use smooth.       
   
Shading
   - Work in HSV to manage chroma and valor in check.
