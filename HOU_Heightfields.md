Erosion
Visible: Debree, Water to see


#### Hydro
Bank Angle - lower: make longer slopes and expanded riverbed   
Spread Itterations - more: longer slopes and expanded riverbed   

Removal rate - how much of debris to remove 
Max Depth - stop when to much debris  
Grid Bias - change values per angle  
#### Thermal  
 
Cut Angle - low: cut faster and allow more erosion   
Grid Bias - change values per angle  (lowwer : more on bottom)  

#### precipitation
Density - low: more lines hi: wide and rear lines  
Evaporation rate - how much water to sink
