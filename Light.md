 is spontaneous emission of light by a substance not resulting from heat; or "cold light".

density of light apera a sq rot of dist. dist^2 intensity (cd) ∝ 1/square of the distance.

- Solid Angle Ω equals [A/r2] sr A full sphere has a solid angle of 4π `steradians` (sr)

- `candela` of luminous intensity uniformly across a solid angle of one `steradian`, the total luminous flux emitted into that angle is one `lumen` (1 cd·1 sr = 1 lm). 
-  isotropic one-`candela` light-source emits a total luminous flux of exactly 4π `lumens`.
- light source that uniformly radiates one `candela` in all directions has a total luminous flux of 1 cd × 4π sr = 4π cd⋅sr ≈ 12.57 `lumens`**(= candela steradians)**  


~4:1 sun/sky (direct light vs shade) intensity ratio
